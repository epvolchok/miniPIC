# Mini Particle-in-Cell code for plasma simulations

(âš  This project is under active development)

- The [Yee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1138693) solver of Maxwell equations:
  
  Field components are separated in time and space, forming two independent groups $`[E_x, E_y, B_z]`$, $`[B_x, B_y, B_z]`$;
- Periodic boundary conditions;
- Visualisation with Python, matplotlib.
